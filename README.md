# valkyrie_simulation
This is a ROS package with possibly necessary components to run a simulation of NASA's Valkyrie in Gazebo with ROS Indigo.
I'm experimenting how the components can be simulated properly.


*This is Major Tom to Ground Control*  
*Val's stepping through the door*  
*And she's floating*  
*in a most peculiar way*  
*And the stars look very different today*  
(a slightly changed section of Space Oddity)
